# Password Generator

This project is a graphical Python application that allows you to generate secure passwords. The user can specify the length of the password as well as the types of characters to include (lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, special characters, and custom characters).

## Features

- **Choose the number of characters**: The user can define the length of the generated password.

- **Include lowercase and uppercase letters**: The user can choose whether to include lowercase and/or uppercase letters.

- **Include numbers**: The user can choose to include numbers in the password.

- **Include special characters**: The user can choose to add special characters to the password.

- **Use custom characters**: The user can specify custom characters to be included in the password.

- **Password generation**: A "Generate" button allows you to create a password based on the selected criteria.

- **Copy the password to clipboard**: Once generated, the password can be copied to the clipboard for easy use.

## Prerequisites
